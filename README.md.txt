Python Command-Line Chat Application
üéØ Objective
The objective of this project is to create a simple, real-time, multi-user chat application that runs entirely in the command line. It demonstrates the fundamentals of network programming and concurrent processing in Python using a client-server architecture.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
Language: Python 3

Core Libraries:

socket: For creating network sockets to establish communication between the server and clients.

threading: To manage multiple client connections simultaneously on the server and to handle sending and receiving messages on the client without blocking.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works (Steps Performed)
The application is split into two main parts: a server script (server.py) and a client script (client.py).

1. The Server (server.py)
Initialization: The server creates a socket and binds it to a specific IP address (localhost) and port, then starts listening for connections.

Accepting Clients: When a client tries to connect, the server accepts the connection and prompts the client for a nickname.

Concurrent Handling: For each connected client, the server launches a new thread. This allows the server to handle multiple clients at the same time without getting stuck waiting for one client's message.

Broadcasting Messages: When the server receives a message from one client, its broadcast() function immediately sends that message to every other client connected to the server.

State Management: The server maintains lists of all active clients and their nicknames, removing them gracefully when a user disconnects.

2. The Client (client.py)
Connection: The client script connects to the server's IP address and port.

Dual-Threading: Upon connecting, the client starts two threads that run in parallel:

A receiving thread that constantly listens for messages sent from the server and prints them to the user's console.

A writing thread that waits for the user to type a message and sends it to the server.

Persistent Session: The main part of the script uses thread.join() to wait for the sending and receiving threads to finish. This is a key step that keeps the client application open so the user can continue chatting.

‚úÖ Outcome
The result is a functional, text-based chat room where multiple users can join from different command-line terminals and exchange messages in real-time. The server application acts as a central hub, displaying logs for connections and disconnections, while each client enjoys a seamless chat experience.A good README helps others understand your project.
